# Cassette-Style Game Case for Game Boy and Game Boy Color

This **Cassette-Style Game Case** provides an efficient storage and display solution for your Game Boy (DMG) and Game Boy Color (CGB) cartridges. Designed to be compatible with standard audio cassette storage and display systems, these cases are ideal for collectors who want to maintain an organized and streamlined look without compromising on space.

## Key Features
- **Cassette Form Factor:** Built for compatibility with existing cassette-style storage and display solutions, making it easy to integrate into your collection.
- **Dual Cartridge Compatibility:** Holds one Game Boy (DMG) or Game Boy Color (CGB) cartridge securely.
- **Two-Part Assembly:** Each case prints in two parts—lid and body—that snap together easily.
- **Customization Options:** Includes plain and branded variations, as well as printable labels to enhance your cases.
- **Perfect for Storage and Display:** These cases are best suited for organized storage and display, fitting perfectly into cassette-style racks and shelves.

## Printing Recommendations
- **Material:** PLA, ABS, or PETG. For durability and heat resistance, ABS or PETG is recommended.
- **Layer Height:** 0.16mm or finer for a smooth surface finish.
- **Infill:** 5% grid for a lightweight yet sturdy case.
- **Support:** No supports required.

## Print Profiles Included (for Bambu Labs printers)
- **For AMS Systems:**
  - One profile for plain versions (all pieces on one plate).

- **For Non-AMS Systems:**
  - One profile featuring both pieces on one plate.
  - One profile featuring each piece on separate plates.

## Printable Labels
Enhance your cases with custom labels! I’ve included printable labels designed to fit perfectly on these cases, along with a **Photoshop .PSD template** so you can design your own labels. The template uses the ultra-condensed variant of the *Univers LT Std* font. Due to licensing restrictions, this font is not included, but the Google Font **"Oswald Bold"** is a suitable replacement.
